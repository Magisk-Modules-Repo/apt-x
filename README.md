# APTX for Android Oreo

**This module is useless if you don't have any aptx supported headphones!**

After Oreo, system should support aptx/HD natively. But this will incur additional licensing fees, so such as Nexus5/6p will not get support for aptx/HD.

*All these libraries extracted from OxygenOS 5.1.5 from OnePlus.*

## Requirements
